We added a special party mode to the game, so you can enjoy it double-time!
Some of the features are a custom button, changing colors, and sound effects.

```python
def party_mode_activated(self):


self.party_mode = 1
# self.play_sound("media/cute_song.mp3")
for cube in self.cubes:
    if cube.marked:
        continue
    cube["bg"] = self.random_color()

for button in self.buttons.values():
    button["bg"] = self.random_color()
self._timer["bg"] = self.random_color()
self._score["bg"] = self.random_color()
self._found_words["bg"] = self.random_color()
self.buttons["PARTY"]["image"] = self.meme
self._display_label["bg"] = self.random_color()


def random_color(self):
    hex_color = ["#" + ''.join([random.choice('ABCDEF0123456789') for _ in range(6)])]
    return hex_color


def party_action(self):
    self.play_sound("media/wow.mp3")
    self._gui.party_mode_activated()

```

Added sound to all buttons, using pygame library:
```python
    def play_sound(self, soundtrack: str):
        pygame.mixer.music.load(soundtrack)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
```

Custom coloring of default board and smart coloring of picked cube path:

```python
def hue_red_color(self, multipler):
    rgb = 255, max(208 - 13 * multipler, 0), max(208 - 13 * multipler, 0)
    rgb_to_hex = "#" + '%02x%02x%02x' % rgb
    return rgb_to_hex


def _make_cube(self, cube_chars: str, row: int, col: int, rowspan: int = 1, columnspan: int = 1) -> tki.Button:
    cube = tki.Button(self._lower_frame, text=cube_chars, **BUTTON_STYLE)
    cube.marked = False
    if row % 2 == col % 2:
        cube["bg"] = REGULAR_COLOR_2
    cube.grid(row=row, column=col, rowspan=rowspan, columnspan=columnspan, sticky=tki.NSEW)
    self.cubes.append(cube)
```

## üì¶ Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è | **Architecture**   | The codebase follows a MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, with separate files for the model, view (GUI), and controller. This promotes separation of concerns and facilitates code maintainability. |
| üîó | **Dependencies**   | The codebase does not have any external dependencies on external libraries or systems beyond the standard Python libraries used for string manipulation and file operations, so it's super light! |
| üß© | **Modularity**     | The system is organized into separate files for different components, such as the BoggleBoard class, GUI, random board generator, and game controller. This modular organization allows for easier extension and modification of individual components. |
| üß™ | **Testing**        | The codebase includes several test files (test_set_1.py, test_set_2.py, test_set_3.py) for testing various aspects of the system. The system uses a combination of manual testing and test cases with assertions to verify correctness. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è | **Performance**    | Evaluating performance can be a demanding task, especially in the absence of dedicated performance monitoring or profiling within the codebase. Nonetheless, our program demonstrates commendable efficiency, swiftly generating random boards and seamlessly handling user moves in real-time for a game of Boggle. We envision even greater performance gains through strategic algorithmic optimizations and effective caching techniques. |

| [boggle_board_randomizer.py](https://github.com/adir-barak/Boggle/blob/main/boggle_board_randomizer.py) | The code generates a random Boggle board using a provided list of letters. It shuffles the dice indices, selects a random letter from each dice, and constructs the board. The generated board is then printed using the pprint function.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It also includes a timing decorator to measure execution time.                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [boggle_model.py](https://github.com/adir-barak/Boggle/blob/main/boggle_model.py)                       | The code defines a BoggleBoard class that represents a Boggle game board. It contains methods for generating valid words, possible moves, and coordinates. It also handles user input, updates the score and found words list, validates words, and allows undoing and resetting the board. The code also includes utility functions for reading words from a file, generating a random board, and manipulating coordinates. |
| [boggle_gui.py](https://github.com/adir-barak/Boggle/blob/main/boggle_gui.py)                           |  The code in this file encompasses the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Boggle game. It's responsible for rendering the game board, handling user interactions, displaying the score and found words, and allowing players to interact with the Boggle game seamlessly. The GUI is thoughtfully designed to provide an engaging and intuitive user experience while complementing the underlying game logic defined in `boggle_model.py`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
